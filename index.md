# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Tisha Patel and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2:
    I surprisingly really enjoyed Lab 2 despite it's simpleness. 
    I think its because it was fun to make kind of silly mad libs out 
    of the main code. Like putting unrealistic nouns and verbs or 
    even mssing with the madlib on my own time by changing the 
    sentences ore what types of words for the user to insert. 
    I think I'm pretty partial to the more game centric or rather
    any lab that relies on user input since I like to interact with 
    the computer.

* Lab 4:
    I've made a similar secret guessing game from part 2 of this 
    lab in javascript in high school, so maybe that is why I enjoyed 
    figuring it out in C++. Again, I'm quite impartial to any game
    related code as I have the most fun while figuring them out.
    Of course the guess game in part 2 was more simplified, but 
    nonetheless I did mess around with it for a good 30 minutes, 
    so I most definitely enjoyed it.

* Lab 9:
    Lab 9's part 2 was by far my favorite for this semester as 
    it added onto the secret game from Lab 4's part 2. I liked
    specifically how we were required to integrate a second 
    player into the game. I also messed around with a copy of the
    code with my friends and made the game range higher to make it 
    a bit more challenging. And while it may be just a longer 
    way of playing "guess the number", I liked that it involved 
    more than one person, as the reason why I like coding and 
    computers in general is because of online games and how 
    they bring people together.
